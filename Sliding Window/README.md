# Sliding Window Technique

The **Sliding Window** technique is a common approach for solving problems that involve finding subarrays, substrings, or specific segments within an array or string. By using a "window" that "slides" across the input, this technique can optimize the solution to problems that would otherwise require nested loops or a brute-force approach.
